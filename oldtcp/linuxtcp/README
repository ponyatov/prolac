This directory contains an older TCP. It is semi-integrated with Linux 2.0
-- it can talk to the lower levels of network processing (IP, etc.), but
not the higher levels (sockets). This is the TCP whose performance
measurements we reported in the SIGCOMM paper.

This TCP does compile, but this preliminary release does not include the
Linux 2.0 kernel patch it needs to function.

This TCP contains some work by David R. Montgomery.
