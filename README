PROLAC TCP 0.0.4
================

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. It is being released in the hope that it is
interesting. The most stable part of this package is the Prolac compiler.
(Well, I guess the MOST stable part is the reference manual. The Emacs mode
is probably next. So maybe the compiler is thirdmost stable.) 'linuxtcp',
the Prolac TCP for Linux 2.2, probably has the best code of the several
TCPs, but it might not even compile!

Work on Prolac is no longer continuing.

The package is laid out like this:

./				This directory.

./doc/				Prolac reference manual and so forth.

./emacs/			A Prolac mode for Emacs.


./prolacc/			prolacc, the Prolac compiler.


./linuxtcp/			Prolac TCP for Linux 2.2. Current work focuses
				here.
./linuxtcp/kernelpatch/		Linux 2.2.11 kernel patch. Lets you select an
				alternate TCP stack.
./linuxtcp/control/		A copy of Linux 2.2.11 TCP, modified to run as
				an alternate TCP stack.
./linuxtcp/src/			Prolac TCP code, including programs to select
				structure offsets and C code to support the
				Prolac TCP module.


./oldtcp/			Old TCPs in Prolac.
./oldtcp/linuxtcp/		Prolac TCP for Linux 2.0.
./oldtcp/usertcp/		Prolac TCP for user-level (uses BPF).

================

To compile: First type `./configure', then `make'. (If you have a Linux
source distribution, but it's not in `/usr/src/linux', give the
`--with-linux=SOURCEDIR' option to `./configure'.) You can also `make' in a
particular subdirectory. Because this is an alpha release, most `make's
will fail.

Please feel free to email me about this package, but it is no longer
supported.
