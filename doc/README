This directory contains the Prolac language reference manual. The Adobe PDF
file `refman.pdf' looks much prettier, but the LaTeX source is provided as
well. (You will need to run LaTeX several times.)

A paper on Prolac, and the Prolac TCP, was published in the 1999 SIGCOMM
conference. It is also available on the Web at
