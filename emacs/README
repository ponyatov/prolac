This directory contains a Prolac mode for Emacs, including a font lock
option (for colored keywords and such). Here's one way to hook it into your
`~/.emacs' file.

	Put the file in a directory `DIR' and add this code to
	`~/.emacs':

	(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name DIR) load-path))
	(defun prolac-mode ()
	  "Load Prolac mode."
	  (interactive)
	  (load-library "prolac-mode")
	  (prolac-mode))
	(setq auto-mode-alist
	      (cons '("\\.pc$" . prolac-mode) auto-mode-alist))

Now Prolac mode will be loaded automatically when you visit a file with
extension `.pc'.
