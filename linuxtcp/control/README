This directory contains a version of Linux 2.2.11 TCPv4 modified to run as
an alternate TCP stack (see the kernel patch in `linuxtcp/kernelpatch').

Type `make atcp.o' to create the module object file (atcp.o); install the
module in your modified kernel with `insmod atcp.o'. From now on, all new
TCP connections will be processed by the `atcp' stack. You can verify this
by looking at the /proc/net/atcp and /proc/net/atcp_snmp files (analogues
to /proc/net/tcp and /proc/net/snmp, but with atcp's statistics).

Removing the module with `rmmod atcp' will transparently transfer any atcp
connections to Linux's default TCP stack. However, if any process is
listening on an atcp socket, you will not be able to remove the module (it
is "in use"). Kill the listening programs and try again.
